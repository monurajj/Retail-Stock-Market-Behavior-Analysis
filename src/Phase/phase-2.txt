# 🧾 **Phase 2 – Project Requirements & Deliverables**

### *Retail Stock Market Behavior – Data Mining Project*

---

## ✅ **1. Full EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) – 25 Marks**

**This module must be fully completed for Phase 2.**
Include all work in the folder: **`01_data_exploration/`**

### **Required Components:**

* Summary statistics
* Distribution plots (Histogram, KDE, Boxplot)
* Correlation heatmap
* Missing data matrix
* Outlier detection (IQR, Z-score)
* Time-trend plots (key for stock behavior understanding)
* Customer-level summaries (RFM-style optional)
* Product/Category-level insights
* Deep insights:

  * Market volatility observations
  * Seasonal hints
  * Geographical demand patterns (if available)

### **Goal:**

Produce a **comprehensive, insight-rich EDA** that justifies **20–25 marks**.

---

## ✅ **2. Research Methodology – 15 Marks**

This section must also be complete for Phase 2.

### **Include the following:**

### **Methodology Steps**

1. Data understanding
2. Data cleaning & preprocessing
3. Association mining
4. Temporal analysis
5. Customer segmentation (overview)
6. Predictive modeling (planned approach)
7. Evaluation metrics

### **Must Describe:**

* Why each method is chosen
* Why it is suitable for *retail stock market behavior*
* Limitations of the approach (very important for high marks)

### **Goal:**

Provide a clear, well-justified methodology targeting **12–15 marks**.

---

## ✅ **3. Consistency & Division of Work – 10 Marks**

Prepare clear, documented teamwork evidence.

### **Required Items:**

* Table showing team members + assigned modules (01–08)
* Rotating leadership plan:

  * Week 1 Leader → Week 2 Leader → Week 3 Leader
* GitHub contribution logs/screenshots
* Collaboration evidence (Google Docs/Notion, optional)

### **Goal:**

Demonstrate structured teamwork and role clarity.

## ⚠ **4. Predictive / Descriptive Analysis – 50 Marks**

*Full modeling is NOT required in Phase 2.*
