## 3. Rotating Leadership Plan

To ensure balanced leadership and shared responsibility, we implement a rotating leadership model where each team member takes the lead for one week.

### Week-by-Week Leadership

| Week | Leader | Responsibilities | Focus Areas |
|------|--------|-----------------|------------|
| **Week 1** | Monu Kumar | Project kickoff, EDA completion, team coordination | Data understanding, initial insights, coding setup |
| **Week 2** | Rhythm Jain | Preprocessing completion, quality assurance, research methodology | Data quality, feature engineering, research documentation |
| **Week 3** | Aditya Raj Sharma | Analysis completion, integration, final deliverables, presentation | Association mining, temporal analysis, documentation, presentation prep |

### Leadership Responsibilities

Each week's leader is responsible for:

1. **Coordination:**
   - Daily stand-up meetings (virtual or in-person)
   - Task assignment and progress tracking
   - Blockers identification and resolution

2. **Quality Assurance:**
   - Code review for assigned modules
   - Documentation review
   - Consistency checks across notebooks

3. **Communication:**
   - Weekly progress reports
   - Stakeholder updates (if applicable)
   - Team meeting facilitation

4. **Integration:**
   - Ensuring module outputs are compatible
   - Data pipeline consistency
   - Final deliverable compilation

### Leadership Rotation Benefits

- **Shared Ownership:** All team members experience leadership responsibility
- **Skill Development:** Each member develops coordination and management skills
- **Fresh Perspectives:** New leadership brings different approaches each week
- **Risk Mitigation:** No single point of failure; knowledge distributed across team
