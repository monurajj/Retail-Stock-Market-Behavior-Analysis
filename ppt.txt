🧩 Slide 2: Problem Statement & Objectives
🧠 Problem Statement

Retailers generate massive amounts of transactional data daily, but most of it remains unused.
The challenge is to convert this raw data into actionable business intelligence for decision-making.

🎯 Objectives

Identify frequently bought-together items (Association Rule Mining)

Detect temporal purchase patterns (time, day, season)

Perform customer segmentation using RFM & clustering

Conduct geographical sales analysis by country

Develop predictive models for sales and behavior forecasting
